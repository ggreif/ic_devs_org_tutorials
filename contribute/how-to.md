# How To Contribute

---

**Follow these basic steps to add tutorials and contribute:**

- Clone our docs repo `git clone git@github.com:icdevs/ic_devs_org_tutorials.git`
- Navigate to the cloned repo root directory
- Install [Retype](https://retype.com/) (this is a great open source tool that helped us to create these docs) `npm install retypeapp --global`
- Run the site locally `retype watch`
- Create a new tutorial
  - Create a file under the tutorials folder (i.e. 'motoko-basics.md')
  - Write the tutorial in Markdown ([Formatting rules](https://github.com/retypeapp/retype/blob/main/guides/formatting.md))
- Create a PR
- That is it. Once we review the changes we will merge with our main branch and your tutorial will be live :rocket: :rocket: :rocket:

#### Happy coding!!!
